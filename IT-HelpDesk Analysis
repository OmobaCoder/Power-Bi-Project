🔍 Participating in FP20 Analytics Challenge 8: Insights from IT Helpdesk Data 🔍

📊 Introduction:
Exciting times as I dive into the world of data analysis in the FP20 Analytics Challenge 8! In this challenge, I've had the opportunity to delve into a reliable dataset that showcases IT ticket data and Agents' profiles for our fictitious company. The goal? To extract actionable insights that help our IT department remain at the forefront of industry developments.

📈 Key Metrics and Transformations:
In this analysis, I've focused on meeting specific requests to provide in-depth insights. The Agents' profiles received a makeover: I split the "Full Name" column into "Name" and "Last Name," ensuring proper capitalization and trimming for consistency. For missing last names, they were derived from the email addresses. I consolidated the "Year/Month/Date of Birth" into a single Date column and calculated agents' ages as of 31st December 2020. This data revealed a valuable distribution of workforce ages.

🌐 Trends and Usage Patterns:
The findings uncovered in this analysis go beyond simple numbers. We've delved into trends, usage patterns, system behaviors, and adherence to service level agreements. These insights shed light on how our IT systems are performing, guiding us towards areas of improvement and optimization.
