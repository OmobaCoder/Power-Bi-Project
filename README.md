# Power-Bi-Project

This repository contains the list of all the completed PowerBi Projects. PowerBI is a powerful data intelligence tool that helps Data Analysts to create visuals that aid the decision-making process of an organization. Like my mentor will say, it is not about the data, but the sense you make of it. Your thinking pattern makes you a data analyst.
